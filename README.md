# Application for secure email exchange: including encryption-decryption with AES-CFB and signature based on EL-GAMAL on elliptic curve.
Data Security and Cryptography  course project / ORT Braude College / Date: 6/2020

The project uses a simple GUI interface using Html, Css, Javascript using flask\
as framework on python allowing the user to stablish a connecting with the server via TCP/IP network communication.\

The messages are encrypted with a Symmetrical Encryption (AES-CFB) and the AES key is encrypted with an Asymmetrical Encryption (EL-GAMAL-ECC) and the result is store in the database creating an unreadable and total secured message for anyone that does not match the digital signature of the receiver.
